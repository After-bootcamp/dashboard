# After Bootcamp

## dashboard

Students who exit coding bootcamps often feel like they are tossed out into the cold with no structure to keep them on track.  That is why we are here.  To bring the structure of bootcamp back to those who want to keep learning.

We are taking former bootcampers, having them build the app using languages they may not know, and working together to both build up their portfolio's and have them learn.
